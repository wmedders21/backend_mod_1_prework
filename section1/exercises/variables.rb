# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Will Medders"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Will"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0
puts "#{first_name} #{is_hungry} #{number_of_pets}"

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
#For first_name, I used a text string. For is_hungry, I used a Boolean. For number_of_pets, I used an integer.
# Explain.
# A name would be text-based and not a numerical value
# the question of hunger is an either/or situation making true/false helpful
# I used an interger for pets because they are typically counted in whole numbers

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "BeBop"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 40
puts "#{first_name} #{is_hungry} #{number_of_pets}"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
total_snacks = healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks
puts total_snacks


#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  # You better bet your boots on that, partner!
