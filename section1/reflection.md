## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

>I found the idea **super learners retain more by teaching others** very true in my previous professional career as a hotel manager. I've trained hundreds of new hires. In my experience, having learners explain a brand new concept fortifies their own understanding even more than that of their audience.

My management team studied "The Culture Code" by Daniel Coyle. It includes a chapter on the concept of **vulnerability** within a team and how it can create **trust** among members. I've already noticed the concept being enabled at Turing in the breakout zoom rooms. This is a powerful tool that we can build over time to help us succeed.  

>I plan to start eating brain foods. *Not brains*. Brain foods.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

``` rb
puts "Hello World!"
```


1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

>`#` a.k.a. octothorpe

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

>An integer is a whole number data type. A float is a data type that uses a decimal point. A float is more precise than an integer, because Ruby's output will round to the next integer when performing operations. Integers are easier to work with and at times more appropriate for the situation.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

```rb
animal = "zebra"
```
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

```rb
puts animal
```
1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

```rb
puts "The lion chased the #{animal} for 5 miles."
```
1. What method is used to get input from a user?

```rb
gets.chomp
```
1. Name and describe two common string methods:

```rb
.length #tells how many characters are in a string
.sub #allows you to substitute a substring item with a replacement
```
